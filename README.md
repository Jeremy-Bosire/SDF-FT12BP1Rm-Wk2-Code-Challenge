# Interactive Shopping List

This is a simple interactive shopping list application that allows users to add items to a shopping list and remove them. It leverages basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation to provide a smooth user experience.

## Features
- **Add Items**: Enter an item in the input field and submit the form to add it to the shopping list.
- **Remove Items**: Click the "Remove" button next to an item to delete it from the list.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The shopping list is dynamically updated as you add or remove items.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository** or **Download the Files** to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the shopping list application in action.
3. Type an item into the input field and click the "Add Item" button or press **Enter** to add it to the list.
4. To remove an item, click the "Remove" button next to the item you want to delete.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-list.git
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. The application should be ready to use immediately.

## Code Explanation
- **HTML** (`index.html`): Contains the basic structure of the webpage, including a form for adding items and a section for displaying the list.
- **CSS**: You can add custom styles for a better user interface (UI) experience. Feel free to modify it to fit your needs.
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`): Contains the logic for adding and removing items from the shopping list using basic DOM manipulation and event handling. When the page loads, a listener waits for form submission. The item is added to the list if valid, and a "Remove" button is created for each item.
